## Regionally optimized fire parameterizations using feed-forward neural networks

This repository contains the code and scripts used in the paper "Regionally Optimized Fire Parameterizations using Feed-Forward Neural Networks".  
It includes the neural network model used for fire parameterizations and the scripts to generate the main figures from the study.

## Contents

- FFNN.py : Implementation of the Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) model used in the study.
- Figures/: Directory containing the output figures generated by the scripts.
- fig2-7.py: Scripts for generating the main figures from the paper.
- sample/ : This folder contains files that can be used to generate the main figure 2, using data from the period 2017-2020. Each dataset includes the period 2017-2020, excluding leap years.
